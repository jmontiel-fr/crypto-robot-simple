I want to simplify my robot deployments and not use docker.
So, I want :
1. to delete local docker generation and related unuseful files
2. delete build image workflow
3. Adapt  workflows to deploy the robot and webapp python 
code using a git clone command on target EC2
4. To inject Binance API keys definitions form Github secrets 
in .env when pushing the .env file 
to AWS. For local testing the .env already contains these keys.
The Binance API key fis file defintion will bee stored manually in a GH secret named
<HOST>_KEYS like JACK_ROBOT_CRYPRO_KEYS.
5. to update all requiremenst, design, tasks and documentation files
