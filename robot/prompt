has databse evolved and is it integradted in create-databse 
and start fresh portfolio ?

update Trading_strategies.md files

is the simulation using the same engines as 
live robot will use the new dynamic strategy ?

are there any strategies that save data in the database and which ones ?
My question is if I restrat a portfolio execution with a fresh new databse 
will it run and I loose information from old runs useful for strategies ?


If my robot stops for any reason., 
If I restart it, will it continue to run as normally, 
with possibly a blank of operation similar to a freze/unfrez period ?
