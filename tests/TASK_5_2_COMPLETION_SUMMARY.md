- ✅ **Requirement 6.3** - Local certificate configuration and test environment
- ✅ **Requirement 6.4** - AWS production certificate configuration and test data

## 🔍 Test Coverage Details

### Trading Operations Coverage
- **Buy Operations**: Dry-run simulation with quantity, price, and fee validation
- **Sell Operations**: Position-based selling with profit/loss calculation
- **Transfer Operations**: Asset-to-asset transfers via sell/buy simulation
- **Portfolio Management**: Balance tracking, position updates, transaction history

### Environment Coverage
- **Local Development**: Self-signed certificates, testnet configuration
- **Containerized Environment**: Docker environment variables, certificate selection
- **AWS Production**: Let's Encrypt certificates, production-like configuration
- **Multi-Environment**: Seamless switching between environments

### Error Handling Coverage
- **Insufficient Balance**: Validates error when trying to buy with insufficient funds
- **Non-existent Position**: Tests error handling for selling non-owned assets
- **Insufficient Quantity**: Validates error when trying to sell more than owned
- **API Integration**: Tests graceful handling of API connection issues

### Safety Measures
- **Dry-Run Mode**: All tests use dry-run mode for safety
- **Testnet Configuration**: Uses Binance testnet for safe testing
- **Small Trade Amounts**: Production-like tests use small quantities
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests don't affect real trading operations

## 🚀 Key Implementation Features

### 1. Comprehensive Test Runner (`run_trading_tests.py`)
- Orchestrates all trading functionality tests
- Provides detailed reporting and coverage analysis
- Validates both local and containerized environments
- Tests AWS deployment simulation scenarios

### 2. Modular Test Architecture
- Separate test classes for different environments
- Reusable test utilities and fixtures

- Easy to extend and maintain

### 3. Requirements Traceability
- Each test explicitly references requirements (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4)
- Validation scripts ensure all requirements are covered
- Clear mapping between tests and specification requirements

### 4. Multi-Environment Support
- Tests work across local, Docker, and AWS environments
- Environment-specific configuration validation
- Certificate management testing for different deployment scenarios
